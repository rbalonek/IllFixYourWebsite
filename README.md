# I'll Fix Your Website
<br /> <br />

## Stuff I used
- React <br />
- Tailwind <br />
- Email JS <br />
- Stripe <br /> <br />

### Description
IllFixYourWebsite.com was made because I bought the domain one evening and figured I'd complete it to add to my portfolio. I used EmailJS for the contact form, and I'll be using Stripe for billing. Hopefully from now on, I'll remember to take screenshots / gifs for the before pictures from now on. For any questions please email rdevbob@gmail.com
