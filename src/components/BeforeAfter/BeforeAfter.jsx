              <p className='font-semibold'>I fixed Matthewâ€™s website to be responsive, and gave it a fresh new look with Parrallax Scrolling. Functionally, I improved on or added:</p>
              <br />
              <p>- Testimonial component with a custom Carousel which allows Video and Text</p>
              <p>- Blog component so he can easily add his new publications as well as share them online.</p>
              <p>- Added a Wix repeater so he can easily add more books with links to the sales pages with only adding them to a spreadsheet database on Wix</p>
              <br />
              <p>I had a great time working with Matthew. Once I made the changes to his site, the goal was to make sure that he can update the site whenever he needs, so I made a few tutorials for him to watch if he ever forgets how to update. I am currently on retainer for any updates or adjustments to the site. </p>
